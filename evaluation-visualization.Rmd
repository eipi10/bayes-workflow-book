# Evaluation, Visualization, and Workflow

Data analysis workflow has three steps:

1.  Model building
2.  Model fitting
3.  Model checking and improvement.

## Visualization

* ShinyStan, analysis & visualization GUI for MCMC:  https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan

* bayesplot:  http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/

## Fitting a series of models

## Statistics beyond data anlysis

* Measurement and data collection, decision analysis, communication

## Diagnostics

* R-hat, divergences, Bayesplot, loo, stacking, etc. Papers:
