# Bayesian Workflow Using Stan (R edition) {-}

This book is an example-driven introduction to Bayesian modeling and inference
using Stan, a platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical
computation.

* Bayesian

_Bayesian inference_ is a framework for estimating parameters and constructing
predictions given probability models and data. _Bayesian data analysis_ is the
larger process of building, fitting, and checking probability models.

* Workflow

By _workflow_ we mean the fuller process of data analysis, including fitting
multiple models to data and figuring out how to include more information in your
model.

* Using Stan

_Stan_ is an open-source computer
program for Bayesian inference and simulation. 

* R edition

Stan can be run from R, Python, Julia, or other scientific/statistical software.
In the examples in this book, we set up data and run Stan from R, but our focus
is on Stan, not the R code.  We hope soon to have translations for this book in
Python and other languages.
