# Stan Case Studies and Example Models

The Stan community has a rich connection of case studies here:  https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies

Each case study is a self-contained knitr or Jupyter notebook with runnable
code.  A good way to learn Stan is to work through these case studies one at a
time in Rstudio, running the code and reading the writeup.  You can also use the
case studies as starting points for your own applied analyses on related
problems.  Some of the case studies are more applied; others focus on Stan
coding or mathematics.

Here we briefly describe some of the case studies.  There are many other case
studies at the above link and from Stan conferences
(https://github.com/stan-dev/stancon_talks) and Stan tutorials
(https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/tutorials.html).  We also have hundreds
of runnable example models here:
https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/wiki; these are direct translations
from other sources and so do not necessarily represent best practice in Bayesian
modeling or Stan coding, but they could be useful in getting started with some
class of models.

## Predator-prey dynamics:  A differential equation model

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/lotka-volterra-predator-prey.html

This is a model of two time series---the number of lynx and the number of
hares---that are related with a system of two differential equation:  When the
number of lynx goes up, they eat more hares and the hare population declines.
When the number of hares goes down, there's less food for the lynx so the lynx
population declines.  The model thus has a natural cycle.  In this case study,
Bob Carpenter explains the differential model mathematically, sets it up in
Stan, fits it to data, checks the fit of the model, and uses it to make
predictions.  The case study concludes with exercises in which you can extend
the model in various ways.

## Splines

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/splines_in_stan.html

Splines are an important method for nonparametric regression.  In this case
study, Milad Kharratzadeh describes a spline model, gives Stan code for fitting
it, and demonstrates with simulated data in R.

## Conditional autoregressive models for spatial data

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/icar_stan.html

Spatial correlation models allow partial pooling among neighboring areas.  In
this case study, Mitzi Morris lays out the mathematics of the ``intrinsic
conditional autoregression model,'' gives Stan code for the model, and fits it
to an example dataset.  She then expands the model, fits it to a second dataset,
and displays the fit graphically.

## Case study on mixture models

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/identifying_mixture_models.html

Mixture models can be difficult to fit because of difficulties in identification
arising from uncertainty about which cases go into which mixture components.
Bayesian inference can help by accounting for this uncertainty and also by using
prior distributions to constrain the fit.  In this case study, Michael
Betancourt discusses these challenges from a mathematical perspective and then
demonstrates using a simple model in Stan.

## Item response models from psychometrics

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/hierarchical_2pl.html

https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/dyadic_irt_model.html

Item response models predict success on test questions (``items'') based on item
characteristics (``difficulty'' and ``discrimination'') and student
characteristics (``ability'').  These models start with simple logistic
regressions with one parameter for each item and each student and can become
arbitrarily complicated by allowing for different response functions for
different questions, multiple dimensions of ability, additional measurements at
the level of items and students. and so on.  The models typically have
nonoverlapping multilevel structure (multiple items and multiple students).  In
the above case studies, Daniel Furr, Nicholas Sim, Brian Gin, Anders Skrondal,
and Sophia Rabe-Hesketh explain and fit some item response models.
